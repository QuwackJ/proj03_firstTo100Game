This is a project I did in college to learn about LinkedLists and coding an iterator.

The goal of the project is to create a CircularLinkedList and a circular iterator.

The FirstTo100 class has a runnable main method which kicks off a game where Players roll a pair of dice to see whose total can reach 100 first. The game stops when a Player reaches a score of 100 or more and the winner is announced. An iterator is used to move onto each Player in the game.
